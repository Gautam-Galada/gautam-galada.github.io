          <h2>DONNA - Dynamic Online Neural Network Assistant</h2>
          <p>
            Inspired by the iconic relationship between Harvey Specter and Donna Paulsen from the TV series "SUITS," 
            DONNA is an intelligent automation framework designed to be every researcher's indispensable assistant. 
            Just as Harvey relies on Donna's expertise and anticipation of his needs, researchers can depend on DONNA 
            to handle the complex, repetitive aspects of neural network research, allowing them to focus on what matters most: innovation.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Core Philosophy:</h3>
          <p>
            The name DONNA represents more than just an acronym—it embodies the idea that every researcher (every Harvey) 
            needs a reliable, intelligent assistant who knows what they need before they even ask. DONNA anticipates research 
            workflows, automates tedious tasks, and ensures that experiments run smoothly, just like her namesake character.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Key Features:</h3>
          
          <h4>1. Assisted Model Training</h4>
          <p>
            DONNA provides intelligent assistance throughout the model training lifecycle. It automatically sets up training 
            configurations based on your model architecture and dataset characteristics, suggests optimal hyperparameters 
            based on similar past experiments, and monitors training progress with intelligent early stopping and checkpoint 
            management. The framework adapts learning rates dynamically and can even suggest architecture modifications if 
            training metrics indicate potential issues.
          </p>
          
          <h4>2. On-the-Fly Dataloader Management</h4>
          <p>
            One of DONNA's most powerful features is its dynamic dataloader system. It automatically detects dataset formats 
            and creates appropriate dataloaders, implements intelligent batching strategies based on available memory, handles 
            data augmentation pipelines seamlessly, and manages multi-GPU data distribution. DONNA can also identify data 
            quality issues and suggest preprocessing steps, ensuring your data pipeline is always optimized.
          </p>
          
          <h4>3. Intelligent Inferencing</h4>
          <p>
            DONNA streamlines the inference process with automated model loading and optimization, batch processing for 
            efficient prediction on large datasets, and support for various deployment scenarios (local, cloud, edge). 
            It handles model quantization and pruning for faster inference and provides detailed performance metrics and 
            bottleneck analysis.
          </p>
          
          <h4>4. Hardware Monitoring</h4>
          <p>
            Real-time hardware monitoring is crucial for ML research, and DONNA excels at this. It tracks GPU utilization, 
            memory usage, and temperature in real-time, provides alerts when resources are being underutilized or overused, 
            generates comprehensive resource usage reports, and suggests optimizations based on hardware utilization patterns. 
            DONNA can even predict when you might run out of memory and suggest batch size adjustments before crashes occur.
          </p>
          
          <h4>5. File Management System</h4>
          <p>
            Research projects can quickly become disorganized with multiple experiments, checkpoints, and datasets. DONNA's 
            intelligent file management system automatically organizes experiment outputs into logical directory structures, 
            implements version control for models and datasets, provides easy access to historical experiments and their 
            configurations, manages disk space by identifying and archiving old experiments, and creates comprehensive 
            experiment logs with reproducibility information.
          </p>
          
          <h4>6. Hyperparameter Tuning</h4>
          <p>
            DONNA implements state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms including Bayesian optimization, 
            grid search, random search, and evolutionary strategies. It intelligently explores the hyperparameter space, 
            learns from previous experiments to focus on promising regions, provides visualization of hyperparameter 
            importance and interactions, and can automatically schedule multiple experiments in parallel across available 
            hardware resources.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Automation Capabilities:</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Experiment Scheduling:</strong> DONNA can queue multiple experiments and execute them sequentially or 
            in parallel based on available resources, ensuring maximum utilization of your computational infrastructure.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Automated Reporting:</strong> At the end of each experiment, DONNA generates comprehensive reports 
            including training curves, validation metrics, hardware utilization, and comparisons with previous experiments. 
            These reports are automatically organized and can be exported in various formats.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Failure Recovery:</strong> If an experiment fails due to hardware issues or other problems, DONNA 
            automatically saves the state and can resume training from the last checkpoint without any manual intervention.
          </p>
          
          <h3>User Experience:</h3>
          <p>
            DONNA is designed with researchers in mind. Its intuitive command-line interface makes it easy to set up and 
            launch experiments with minimal configuration. The framework learns from your preferences over time, adapting 
            its suggestions and automation to match your research style. Whether you're running a quick prototype or a 
            large-scale experiment, DONNA adjusts its behavior to provide the right level of assistance.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Integration with Research Workflow:</h3>
          <p>
            DONNA seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, supports Jupyter notebooks 
            for interactive research, connects with experiment tracking tools like Weights & Biases and MLflow, and provides 
            APIs for custom extensions and integrations. This ensures that DONNA fits naturally into existing research 
            pipelines without requiring major workflow changes.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Impact on Research Productivity:</h3>
          <p>
            By automating the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of ML research, DONNA allows researchers to focus on 
            the creative and intellectual challenges of their work. Users report significant time savings in experiment 
            setup, monitoring, and management, allowing them to run more experiments and iterate faster on their ideas. 
            The intelligent suggestions and automated optimizations often lead to better model performance and more efficient 
            use of computational resources.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Future Development:</h3>
          <p>
            DONNA is continuously evolving with planned features including integration with AutoML techniques for 
            architecture search, support for federated learning workflows, enhanced collaboration features for research teams, 
            and AI-powered experiment suggestion based on research goals. The vision is to make DONNA not just an assistant, 
            but a true research partner that grows more valuable the more you work with it.
